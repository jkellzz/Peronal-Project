### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

Component
Whiteboard wireframe
nav bar
photo and about me
Flexbox
Grid
barckground/schooling
contact form



#### PostMVP 

Carosel for flexbox
Create cards in grid
hamburger menu
info button on cards
Add responsive to nav
add decoration to site


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Whiteboard Wireframe | H | 30 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| Nav Bar | H | 3hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |

| Flexbox | H | 4hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |

| Background | H | 4hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Contact Form | H | 4hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Carosel | M | 2hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Grid Cards | M | 2hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Info Button on cards | M | 4hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
